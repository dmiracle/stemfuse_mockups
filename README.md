# STEM Fuse Mockups

Here we are trying out some other STEM Fuse site designs to use with our Drupal back end.

## Plan 

- Get designs from Alex
- Turn them into web pages with Bootstrap

### Why Bootstrap

There are lots of possible choices for building out our new UI. The options I seriously considered are:

1. CSS Grid and Flexbox
2. Bootstrap

Decided on bootstrap because it comes with more "out of the box". I would have to spend more time creating UI components with CSS Grid. 

## How to make this one

1. Download Bootstrap from [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/download/). 
2. Add css and js folders to new repo.
3. Create HTML 

Started using [emmet codes](https://docs.emmet.io/) to create HTML -- super slick. These are already in vscode. For example:
```
html>head+body
```
